Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.\n2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines the sign of the integer. If the next character is neither `'-'` nor `'+'`, no sign is assumed.\n3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then clamp the integer to stay in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2^31` should be clamped to `-2^31`, and integers greater than `2^31 - 1` should be clamped to `2^31 - 1`.\n6.

These pointers form a multilevel doubly linked list. Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the `head` of the first level of the list. The value of `head.val` will be returned. The result should be returned as a flattened doubly linked list. The nodes should be flattened in order: current level, then its child level, then the next node on the current level.\n\n**Constraints**\nInput format:\nEach line represents a level of the list. Nodes on a level are space-separated. 'null' indicates no child. 'next' is used for next node, 'child' for child node. Example: `1 next 2 child 3 next 4` means node 1 points to 2, node 2 has child 3, node 3 points to 4. Input ends with a blank line.\n\nOutput format:\nA single line of space-separated integers representing the flattened linked list.",
